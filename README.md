# Welcome to VINOLOG
### Helping to document the wines of the world...
---
This site is design for you to log all the specifics of a wine, as well as the strong opinions you may have.   If you love a wine, why not share it?   Wine tasting notes with high regard can be browsed in a universal feed.   Gather and discuss said opinions of a rugged Barolo, or mineral driven Sancerre.  Expand your knowledge by learning about wines that may be lesser known, but equally delicious.
